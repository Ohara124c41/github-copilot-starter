# System Requirements (INCOSE-style)

## 1. Introduction
This document captures the functional and non-functional requirements for the Sudoku project. It follows a lightweight INCOSE-style format covering stakeholders, use cases, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Stakeholders
- Student (primary user): wants a playable, accessible Sudoku game with difficulty settings and score tracking.
- Instructor/Grader: expects rubric conformance (unique-solution puzzles, top-10 persistent scoring, hints/checking features, React+NextJS app structure).
- Developer/Maintainer: needs clarity on architecture, testability, and extensibility.

## 3. Functional Requirements
FR-1: The application shall present a 9x9 Sudoku board to the user.
FR-2: The application shall support New Game with difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) that control the number of prefilled clues.
FR-3: The application shall only generate puzzles that have exactly one valid solution (no guessing required).
FR-4: The application shall prevent modification of prefilled cells and visually distinguish them.
FR-5: The application shall restrict inputs to digits 1-9 and provide immediate validation feedback for illegal moves (duplicates in row/col/box).
FR-6: The application shall provide Hint (fills one empty cell, disables it, counts as a hint used) and Check (highlights incorrect cells) features.
FR-7: The application shall measure elapsed time per puzzle and persist the top-10 fastest completion times locally (localStorage) including name, difficulty, time, hints used, and date.
FR-8: The application shall support dark mode (toggle) and maintain accessible contrast ratios.
FR-9: The application shall be implemented using React + NextJS (App Router) and split into reusable components (Board, Cell, Controls, Top10Scores).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-1: Accessibility: color contrast and keyboard navigation support for inputs must be provided.
NFR-2: Responsiveness: the UI must render reasonably on mobile and desktop screens.
NFR-3: Performance: puzzle generation & uniqueness checks shall finish within a few seconds on modern hardware.
NFR-4: Maintainability: the codebase shall use ES6+, JSDoc comments, modular structure, and include ESLint.

## 5. Quality Attributes
- Usability: intuitive controls, clear success/failure messages, and hint/check affordances.
- Reliability: puzzles must be valid and solvable; no crashes on normal input.
- Portability: runs in modern browsers; persistent storage uses localStorage.

## 6. Constraints
- The starter repository includes a legacy `sudoku.js` to be migrated/refactored; retain backwards compatibility where practical.
- No server-side persistence—leaderboard is local only.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
- Sample puzzles generated by the application must be solvable and have exactly one solution (automated check).
- Top 10 list updates correctly on successful completion when the elapsed time qualifies.
- The codebase uses ES6+ and is structured into components when migrated to React/NextJS.
- 3x3 boxes render in alternating colors; text uses Udacity blue `#02B3E4` where specified.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Add pencil-mark note-taking per cell.
- Add undo/redo and persistence of partially completed games.
- Server-side leaderboard sync (optional).
